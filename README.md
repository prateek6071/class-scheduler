# Class-Scheduler

A desktop application written in Python using the QT framework that allows a user to input parameters and automatically generate schedules for students and teachers. Inputs the user can provide are:
  * Teachers
  * Students
  * Classes
  * Rooms
  * Time schedules
  * Grade levels
  
The user will be able to fill in information for each component and then the program will run the data through an algorithm to generate schedules for all the students and teachers. In addition, the user would be able to look at the availability of a room on any given day. The application would also display any conflicts to the user, which then would require manual resolution.
